{"name":"How to write web application using Angular js","tagline":"Angular js","body":"### Welcome to Angular js Application.\r\n   This is a simple application built on top of angular using northwind db data as json.\r\nHere we don't require any jquery library for DOM manipulation, any handlebar library for template compiling and rendering and any formatting library. All you need is only the angular js libraries.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Folder structure\r\n\r\n```\r\nnorthwind\r\n* css\r\n* data\r\n* img \r\n* js\r\n* partials\r\n* index.html\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Lets start writing the App\r\n\r\nWe've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages? Check out the documentation at http://help.github.com/pages or contact support@github.com and weâ€™ll help you sort it out.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
